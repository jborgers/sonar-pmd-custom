# Sonar PMD custom plugins for Java and Kotlin

These two SonarQube plugins enable adding custom Java PMD6 rules and custom Kotlin PMD7 rules to SonarQube. 
This project is sponsored by [Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.com/).


Since current production version of PMD is 6.x, the first plugin supports custom rules for Java using PMD6. 

Since Kotlin is only supported starting with PMD7, the second plugin supports custom rules for Kotlin using PMD7. 

Both plugins need the respective PMD plugin installed in SonarQube. So, for supporting Java and Kotlin custom rules, 
4 Sonar plugins are needed.

Supports SonarQube 9.8+.
